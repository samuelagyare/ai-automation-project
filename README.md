## Full-Stack AI Automation Project
This project is a full-stack application that leverages an AI agent to provide intelligent, conversational responses. The backend is built with Python and FastAPI, the AI agent uses the LangChain framework to connect to Google's Gemini models, and the frontend is a responsive chat interface built with React. The entire application is deployed on the Google Cloud Platform.

Key Features
Conversational AI: Engage in natural, human-like conversations powered by Google's Gemini model.

Live & Publicly Accessible: Fully deployed on Google Cloud Platform, accessible to anyone in the world.

Robust Backend: Built with FastAPI, the Python backend is fast, scalable, and includes interactive API documentation.

CI/CD Ready: The backend is containerized with Docker, ready for automated build and deploy pipelines.

Secure API Key Management: API keys are handled securely as environment variables in the cloud, not in the code.

CORS Enabled: The backend is configured to securely accept requests from the deployed frontend.

A Google AI API Key

Installation & Running Locally
1. Clone the repository:

git clone <your-repo-url>
cd ai-automation-project

2. Backend Setup:

cd backend

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
# On Windows: .\\venv\\Scripts\\activate
# On macOS/Linux: source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies from the requirements file
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create a .env file and add your API key
# GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-key-here"

# Run the backend server
uvicorn main:app --reload

The backend will be running at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

3. Frontend Setup (in a new terminal):

cd frontend

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the frontend server
npm start

The frontend will open automatically at http://localhost:3000.

Deployment
